- 👋 Hi, I’m @Toshiyuki-I-13
- 👀 I'm interested in programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming.
- 💞️ I am looking for someone who has little programming experience and is studying programming. Because I'm just starting to learn the basics of programming and want to be an engineer who can study and do software development and web production.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
